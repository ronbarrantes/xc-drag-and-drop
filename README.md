# Drag and Drop Challenge

## Description

The challenge is to create a drag and drop interface for a group of servers and nodes. The objective is for the user to drag a node onto a server, and then for the server to notify the node was dragged onto it. In the challenge, the server is aware of itself and of the node that was dragged onto it.
